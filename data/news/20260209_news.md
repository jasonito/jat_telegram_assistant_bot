The variable aperture has been absent from Samsung’s smartphone camera arsenal for years, but given that Apple has been reported on multiple occasions to bring the technology to its iPhone 18 Pro and iPhone 18 Pro Max, the company has little choice but to respond. As for the lineup that’s expected to receive the upgrade, the Galaxy S26 series could be the obvious recipient, but plans can change in the blink of an eye. Multiple generations of Galaxy S flagships have remained stagnant in camera technology; variable aperture could be the first step from Samsung towards reviving innovation Samsung’s Electro-Mechanics [&#8230;]
