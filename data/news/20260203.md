When ChatGPT launched, in November of 2022, it started a race that almost immediately consumed the tech industry. OpenAI didn't invent the concept of AI, but most of the state-of-the-art technology was confined to research labs at companies and institutions around the world. Then, suddenly, it was everywhere. And better than anyone expected. So many [&#8230;]

Obsidian Entertainment was one of the busiest studios in 2025, releasing not just one, but three major titles last year. It began the year with Avowed in February 2025, followed by Grounded 2 releasing in early access in July 2025, and capped off the year with The Outer Worlds 2 in October 2025. Two of those three games were misfires in terms of sales (though they were fairly well received by critics, especially here on Wccftech), and a new report from Bloomberg digs into how the studio is looking to bounce back and "reinvent itself."

Since moving on from the Gamebryo engine, which powered The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, its faithful remake (which proved successful even without having great player retention) and Fallout 3, Bethesda used its Creation Engine for all its games, including The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim and Fallout 4. Despite powering what is widely considered one of the best role-playing games of all time, the engine caught some flak from gamers for how it manages the sprawling worlds of the games it powers, forcing dated, immersion-breaking loading screens, as seen in Starfield. For this reason, many wish Bethesda would leave this engine [&#8230;]

Before we dive into the ongoing NVIDIA-OpenAI fiasco, it's important to note the fundamentals that underpin the partnership. Team Green is currently the world's largest AI infrastructure provider, and almost all hyperscalers are dependent on the company, not just for hardware, but also for financial commitments in the form of "collaborations" or whatever you call it. At the same time, NVIDIA [&#8230;]

South Korean developer Pearl Abyss announced today that the upcoming open world action/adventure game Crimson Desert has been wishlisted by over two million users across all platforms. It is yet another strong confirmation of the mounting hype behind Crimson Desert. It's been a while since the market got a fantasy triple-A open world game of this scale (the world is said to be twice as big as Skyrim's), after all, and fans can't wait to get their hands on the game after many years of development. Thankfully, in addition to celebrating wishlist milestones, Pearl Abyss is still sharing little nuggets [&#8230;]

All you need to do (after paying the $250 monthly fee for Google's AI Ultra subscription) is write a prompt to start generating your own game-like worlds, but besides the paywall barrier, there are more than a few limitations to this technology in terms of it becoming the new way to make games.
