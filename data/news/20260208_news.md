The AM4 platform has been constantly dominating in the mainstream market, and despite AM5 being the most popular platform, AM4 still has the best-selling chipsets. AMD B550 Chipset Motherboards Remain the Best-Selling Motherboards in NA and EU Regions It doesn't surprise us to see AM4 making a comeback since the eye-watering DDR5 RAM prices and expensive AM5/LGA 1851 platform have made building a decently fast computer insanely difficult. While DDR4 prices have been rapidly increasing at almost the same rate as DDR5 RAM kits, the overall cost for DDR4 platforms is still comparatively lower than DDR5 platforms due to several [&#8230;]

There's probably nothing that stops AMD from releasing FSR 4 for non-RDNA 4 GPUs, but it just keeps avoiding it. AMD Says "No Updates to Share at This Time" in Response to Whether it Will Release FSR 4 for Previous-Gen RDNA GPUs It has been proven multiple times that AMD's latest FSR 4 upscaler works on older RDNA GPUs such as RDNA 2 and RDNA 3. This isn't something new, as we have been seeing users finding workarounds to turn on FSR 4 on RX 6000 and RX 7000 GPUs using the leaked files. When AMD accidentally released the INT8 [&#8230;]

In our 'eagle's view' of the RAM market, we have noticed that the price trend has become more consistent over the past few days, but the reason isn't optimistic. Memory Prices Are Reaching Stability, But Suppliers Are Still Looking to Reap More Profits We all hope that memory modules will become affordable for consumers, but recent price trends and supply chain conditions suggest prices will only increase in 2026. While looking at RAM price trends on PCPartPicker, we noticed that both DDR4 and DDR5 were 'flattening out'. There are many reasons behind such a price movement, but calling the memory [&#8230;]
