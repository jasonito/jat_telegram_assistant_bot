1、并行多开。同时开 3 ~ 5 个 git worktree，每个跑一个 Claude 会话，互不干扰。还可以设置快捷键比如 za、zb、zc 一键切换，或者专门留一个 worktree 只用来看日志跑查询，分工明确。

2、复杂任务一定要先进计划模式，把心思花在打磨计划上，计划到位了 Claude 基本能一次性搞定。一旦感觉方向不对，别硬推，立刻切回计划模式重新来。

3、好好维护 http://CLAUDE.md 文件。每次纠正 Claude 的错误，顺手加一句 “把这条更新到 http://CLAUDE.md，下次别再犯”。Claude 特别擅长给自己写规则，时间久了出错率会明显下降。

4、重复的事情就封装成技能或斜杠命令，用 Git 管理，跨项目复用。比如搞个 /techdebt 命令每次会话结束跑一下清理重复代码，省得每次手动操作。

5、让 Claude 自己修 Bug。比如用了 Slack MCP 之后，把 Bug 讨论帖往 Claude 一丢，说句 "fix" 就行。分布式系统出问题就让它看 docker logs，不用管它怎么修，它的排查能力比你想象的强。

6、提示词可以更有创意。比如让 Claude 当考官：“先考考我这些改动理解对不对，我过了再提 PR”，或者说 “证明给我看这个能用”，让它对比 main 和功能分支的差异。修复完问题后觉得一般，就说 “根据你现在掌握的所有信息，推翻重来，给我个更优雅的方案”。

7、选择合适的终端环境。比如 Ghostty，渲染和颜色支持都不错。可以用 /statusline 定制状态栏显示上下文用量和当前分支，给终端标签上色命名，一个标签对应一个任务。推荐试试语音输入，因为说话比打字快 3 倍，提示词会写得更详细（macOS 按两下 fn 就能用）。

8、使用子代理 Subagents。想让 Claude 更快完成任务的时候，请求后面加一句 "use subagents"。把独立的小任务丢给子代理处理，主代理的上下文就能保持干净。还可以用钩子把权限请求转给 Opus 4.5，让它判断安不安全、自动批准。

9、利用 Claude 做数据分析。让它用 bq 命令行直接查 BigQuery，实时拉数据做分析。团队在代码库里提交了现成的 BigQuery 技能，让大家都能用。创始人说他半年没手写过一行 SQL 了。其实任何有命令行或 API 的数据库都能这么玩。

10、靠 Claude 学习新东西。在 /config 里开启 “解释型” 输出风格，让它讲清楚每个改动背后的原因。还可以让它生成 HTML 幻灯片讲解陌生代码，或者画 ASCII 图解释协议和架构。甚至可以搭个间隔重复学习的技能，你说出自己的理解，Claude 会进行追问，帮你查漏补缺。

===

这些技巧虽然是针对 Claude Code 分享的，但其实大部分思路在 Cursor 等 AI 编程工具里也通用。核心就是把 AI 当成真正的队友，让它干更多、记更多、持续迭代。用起来之后你会发现，效率真的能上一个台阶。

学会了学废了！🤪 我也开始用 Ghostty 了~

, we now have proof that the EU has been actively censoring legal content that goes against their agenda—and that they interfered in at least 8 European elections, including the Dutch elections of 2023 and 2025, by meeting with social media platforms to pressure them to censor political speech in the days before the vote.

Leading up to the Dutch elections of 2023 the EU commission even made the then Dutch Interior Ministry 
@hugodejonge
 a "trusted flagger" entitled to make priority censorship requests under the DSA. 

What kind of political speech did they want to censor, you ask?

- “Populist rhetoric”
- “Anti-government/anti-EU content”
- “Anti-elite” content
- “Political satire”
- “Anti-migrant and Islamophobic content”
- “Anti-refugee content/anti-immigrant sentiment”
- “Anti-LGBTQI content”
- “Meme subculture”

In other words, anything that goes against their agenda, anything remotely right-wing or conservative, and anything pertaining to the disastrous migrant situation we have here in Europe.

And guess what the only platform was that did not cooperate? 
@X
, of course. The same platform that the EU is fining for 120 million euros under the DSA and the same platform that is currently having its offices raided in France. 

This is the type of stuff over which governments should resign and institutions like the EU should fall. Democracy is dead. 

Abolish the EU! Now!

- [01:47:34] (telegram) jasonitobocchi | jasonitobocchi: China's CXMT and YMTC to massively expand memory output amid global crunch

- According to reporting by Nikkei Asia, China’s two major memory manufacturers view the global supply shortage as an opportunity for “emerging players” to catch up and are embarking on record-level aggressive capacity expansions. The increased production volume is highly likely to be used primarily to meet domestic demand within China.

- ChangXin Memory Technologies (CXMT), China’s largest DRAM maker, is currently expanding its Shanghai plant. Upon completion, its total production capacity is expected to be two to three times larger than that of its Hefei facility. The plant will produce DRAM for servers, PCs, and automobiles. Equipment move-in is reported to be around the second half of 2026, with mass production starting in 2027. Additionally, an expansion of HBM production lines is underway in Shanghai.

- Wuhan-based NAND manufacturer Yangtze Memory Technologies (YMTC) is constructing its third plant in Wuhan, targeting a production start in 2027. The company plans to allocate 50% of the new plant’s capacity to DRAM and is reportedly discussing cooperation with domestic packaging firms for HBM. Furthermore, according to official statements, they have found ways to produce using less advanced equipment, partially bypassing export controls, and there are even claims that they have finalized their own proprietary DRAM development.

- While YMTC previously had the possibility of supplying Apple, it faced setbacks after being added to the U.S. Entity List in 2022. Since then, it has regained growth momentum driven by China’s localization policies and favorable market conditions.

- According to Yole Group estimates, CXMT is the world’s fourth-largest DRAM maker following Samsung Electronics, SK Hynix, and Micron (with a market share of approximately 11.1% based on production capacity), which could expand to about 13.9% by 2027. The report also mentions that CXMT has secured major tech customers such as Alibaba Cloud and references documents from China International Capital Corporation (CICC).

- CXMT is pushing for a transition to DDR5-grade technology beyond DDR4/LPDDR4 and aims to support domestic HBM demand in China. The company is reported to be targeting a 29.5 billion yuan (approx. $4.25 billion) raise through an IPO on the Shanghai Stock Exchange.

- Estimates also suggest that YMTC’s NAND market share could expand from about 12% in 2025 to 15% by 2028. Gary Huang assessed that “the supply shortage favored emerging players, and the combination of financial conditions, localization, and government support is promoting the adoption of alternative supply sources.”

Jensen framed a benchmark: about $50B of capex for a 1GW datacenter. That number belongs in the same mental shelf as iconic public works. The Golden Gate Bridge cost roughly $35M in the 1930s and opened in 1937. It still carries daily life nearly a century later. Both types of projects are bets on flow. One moves people and goods across water. One moves computation across networks. Both require power systems, supply chains, maintenance cultures, and rules that decide who benefits and who pays. A useful lens is simple: cost, use life, and spillover. The sticker price is visible. The real story is how long the asset stays useful, and how widely its gains diffuse into society.

A bridge has a public presence. It ages in full view. It becomes part of a city’s identity and a region’s productivity. Its benefits are easy to narrate: time saved, trade expanded, labor markets widened, neighborhoods connected, resilience improved. A datacenter is a quieter monument. Concrete, transformers, cooling, fiber, and racks that turn electricity into capability. The building can last decades. The hardware refreshes quickly. The output is less tangible, and it still reshapes welfare. Faster research cycles. Cheaper experimentation. New tools in medicine, education, manufacturing, and design. New dependencies in security, energy, and governance. When capability becomes infrastructure, the biggest variable is stewardship.

If a $50B, 1GW datacenter is treated as modern infrastructure, what civic expectations travel with it? Reliability, safety, accountability, and resilience have always been part of the bridge bargain. Compute raises parallel questions: access, transparency, competitive openness, energy discipline, and who captures the spillovers. The Golden Gate Bridge created a shared shortcut through geography. Compute creates shortcuts through complexity. Both change the map. Both concentrate power unless deliberate choices distribute it. The comparison is not a verdict. It is an invitation. Which asset feels more like a public work, and what return should society expect when the next monument is mostly invisible?

- [09:35:18] (telegram) jasonitobocchi | jasonitobocchi: 公股行庫陸續就大陸2026年經濟展望提出報告，多認為在房地產下行、通縮壓力與內捲結構持續下，將拖累2026年經濟表現，復甦力道有限，但「兩新」、「兩重」及中央擴大內需政策提前落地，政策效果可望顯現，第一季GDP（國內生產毛額）增速有望改善，且預計仍有增量政策穩步出台。

公股銀財富管理部門研究報告指出，大陸2025年第四季GDP年成長率4.5％，符合市場預期，隨著物價降幅收斂，名目GDP年增率較前期小幅上行，顯示通縮對經濟的壓力逐步緩解。從2025年12月經濟指標觀察，出口仍是工業生產的主要支撐，科技展現相對韌性，高技術製造也維持一定動能，在設備更新、產能提升與官方政策引導下，對整體工業產出形成正向貢獻。

消費方面，當前首批「以舊換新」資金下達，可望優化耐久財零售結構，但高基期壓力仍需時間消化。投資端，固定資產投資仍面臨下行壓力，房地產相關投資偏弱，民間投資情緒仍待恢復。

公股銀認為，大陸政府相關政策陸續出台，包含專項貸款、產業扶植與地方財政支持等措施，疊加效果有機會在2026年第一季顯現。展望後市，短期觀察重點在於，3月大陸全國「兩會」（全國人大、政協）對財政、貨幣與產業政策的再定調，預期將聚焦兼顧安全與經濟的產業，包括人工智慧（AI）、國防工業、航天技術、半導體及量子科技等新質生產力產業。

貨幣政策方面，公股銀分析，2026年寬鬆力度可望略高於2025年，預期中國人民銀行將再降息20個基本點、降準50個基本，至於財政政策則維持擴張，持續透過消費補貼與投資拉動需求。整體而言，能否有效結合短期刺激與結構改革、重建民間信心，將是大陸中長期經濟成長的關鍵。
